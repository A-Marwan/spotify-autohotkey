Spotify AutoHotKey Controller
=============================
Based on *chripopper*'s script posted on the [AHK forums](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/35402-spotify-and-ahk/page-2), this [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script (or the compiled executable) offers global hotkeys to control the Spotify Windows client.

Launching the controller will automatically launch Spotify too.
~~and (as of now) closing the controller closes Spotify as well~~.

This is just something I put together for my own use.
Huge thanks to *chripopper*, wherever you are. :)

Download the executable right **[HERE](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3483483/misc/spotify-controller/spotify-controller.exe)** if you don't want to fiddle with git.
