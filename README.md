Spotify AutoHotKey Controller
=============================
Based on *chripopper*'s script posted on the [AHK forums](http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/35402-spotify-and-ahk/page-2), this [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script (or the compiler executable) offers global hotkeys to control the Spotify Windows client.

Launching the controller will automatically launch Spotify too
and (as of now) closing the controller closes Spotify as well.

This is just something I put together for my own use.
Huge thanks to *chripopper*, wherever you are. :)
